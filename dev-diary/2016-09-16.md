In learning more about electron, I have come to understand that you can create a
BrowserWindow instance that does not have node integration. Current advice is to
disable node integration in the browser window as a security precaution. The
default value for this flag, nodeIntegration, is true. If node modules are
required, the required modules can be preloaded, via a preload.js file, and
assigned to global variables (or whatever structure is convenient).

Here is an example of making the ipcRenderer module available to a non node
integrated browser window. Create a file "preload.js" with the following
contents.

window.ipcRenderer = require('electron').ipcRenderer;

Then, to pass this information to the BrowserWindow, the following options need
to be passed to the constructor:

const window = new BrowserWindow ({
  [...]
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false,
    preload: <path to preload.js>
  }
})

Then in the window process, you can access window.ipcRenderer to access the node
module.

All of that said, however, today I would like to try and edit the timer
settings. I have them saved and can now reload the values but I would like the
ability to edit them. Once edited, I would like to have the changes immediately
applied.

In looking at my calendar, it might be next week :(
