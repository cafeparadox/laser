I started work on the timer yesterday and it was slow going. Most of my delays
were trying to figure out how to do modules and DOM manipulation. Originally,
both actions were being done in the same file but I have now separated the two.
I would like to introduce some testing but I am unfamiliar with the tools and
libraries currently available.

After looking into how to define modules, it is starting to dawn on me exactly
how different electron development can be. Being able to blend both web and node
APIs simultaneously, while offering a lot of flexibility, should be considered
carefully.

For instance, the timer module I wrote yesterday requires an EventEmitter, which
is only available in Node, but is being used on what should be a simple web
page. Which, from what I can tell, sounds a lot like a [content script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Guides/Content_Scripts).

The main issue I can see here is reusability. You could spend quite a bit of
time working on a desktop application, using web technologies, that doesn't work
on the web.
